### Acknowledgements

- I would like to begin by sharing that I am a self-taught graphic designer. However, I sometimes hesitate to fully embrace that title, as I deeply respect those who have pursued formal education in the field. For this reason, I prefer to describe myself as a Creative Visual Strategistâ€”a term that reflects both my design approach and the thoughtful creativity I bring to my work.

- I would also like to sincerely apologize for not reaching out to my mentor [Daniel Hamilton](https://github.com/dlhamilton) prior to starting this project. Due to personal life challenges and delays, I was only able to complete my Boardwalk Games lessons on April 6th. With the project deadline set for the 18th, Iâ€™ve had to accelerate my progress in order to catch up. I am committed to doing my best to stay on track and successfully complete the course.

- Lastly, I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the Support Team for kindly allowing me additional time to finish my project. Your understanding and flexibility are truly appreciated.
